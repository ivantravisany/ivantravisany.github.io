[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=vscode,unity,github,obsidian)](https://skillicons.dev)

I’m a bilingual Data Analyst from Canada 🇨🇦 with some hands-on experience in healthcare and agriculture settings. My main toolkit includes analyzing, transforming, and bringing data to life with dynamic visuals 📊 using Power BI. I also enjoy crafting apps from scratch with Power Apps 📱 to solve real-world problems and streamline workflows with Power Automate-all integrated into Dataverse, so it’s a one-stop shop for end-to-end solutions ⚡️

I am also skilled in Python 🐍, though I haven’t had many chances to use it on the job. And, on the side, I’m diving into C# and Unity 🎮 to create my own games... Learning lots, mastering none, right? 😂

Anyhow, here I will be showcasing all my projects, little by little, so it's a work in progress 💪🏼. Feel free to explore what I got so far below:
