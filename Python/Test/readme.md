# Customer Segmentation Analysis

This test project analyzes and cleans data of an external csv file

## Project Objectives
- To test how ipynb files work in a git environment
- To further test git capabilities and procedures

## How to Use
- I'm not expecting anyone to use this, since it's more like a hands-on experience with git, but I guess you could simply clone this repository and run the ipynb file
