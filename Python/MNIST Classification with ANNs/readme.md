# Having fun with Fashion MNIST using ANNs

## **Objective**:
The objective is to build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using the Fashion MNIST dataset available in Keras. You will create visualizations, compile the model, and evaluate its performance on both training and validation sets. Finally, use the trained model to predict on the test data.

## **Requirements**:

1. Load and Explore the Fashion MNIST Dataset:

    * Load the Fashion MNIST dataset from Keras. Familiarize yourself with the dataset's structure and the classes it contains.

2. Data Preprocessing:

    * Preprocess the data as needed for training an ANN. This may include scaling the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1 and reshaping the data.

3. Visualizations:

    * Create visualizations to explore the dataset. Include at least:

        * Display sample images from the dataset.
        * A bar chart showing the distribution of samples across different classes.

4. Build an Artificial Neural Network:

    * Design and implement an ANN model for classifying Fashion MNIST images. Experiment with different architectures, activation functions, and layer configurations.

5. Compile the Model:

    * Compile the ANN model using an appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric. Choose metrics such as accuracy to monitor during training.

6. Train the Model:

    * Train the compiled model on the training set. Monitor and visualize the training process using training loss and accuracy.

7. Evaluate the Model:

    * Evaluate the trained model on the validation set. Calculate and visualize both training and validation losses and accuracy.

8. Test Set Prediction:

    * Use the trained model to predict classes for the test set. Display a few sample predictions along with the corresponding images.
